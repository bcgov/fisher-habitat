    returns statistics about Fisher habitat within a cutblock polygon.
    Cutblock must be in BC Albers EPSG:3005.

    The density of landscape features that Fishers rely on are retrieved
    from polygons from the `fisher_fhe` table.  The density is converted
    to a count by multiplying by the intersecting area of every fisher_fhe
    polygon and the cutblock polygon.

    Polygons with different types of warnings are also returned as `yellow_polygons`
    and `red_polygons`.
